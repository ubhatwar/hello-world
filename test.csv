I have been a loyal customer for a extremley long time and the person I spoke with last was terrible, no customer service, terrible.",Call Back Required
CD2D5803-680B-4741-99A4-589A55A98FE1,2,"Despite many many years of being a loyal customer this last contract with ABC has been discussing. No follow up unless I keep up the phone calls. As yet I still have a phone for nearly 2 years that I have not been able to utilise to my full desire, as the handset your company sent me was inferior. There was an offer to replace the phone but that was after 8 months or so and I had to sign a new contract. Which I did not agree to, however when I check my details online, I see that ABC have adjusted my contract to reflect the longer period despite, no approval from me nor any satisfaction.  Absolutely outrageous. I will never go with ABC again, 10 plus years of being a loyal customer and your treated as though loyalty is nothing.",Call Back Required

CD2D5803-680B-4741-99A4-589A55A98FE1,20,I am happy with the way the phone network is performing. What I am not happy with is how the process of entering the contracts is undertaken and also how when something goes wrong that is the responsibilty of ABC that one employee promises something and then another says that is incorrect and the promise is not honoured.  If you expect your clients to honour their commitment with you then the same courtesy should be extended from your end!! It is only fair.,Customer Service
